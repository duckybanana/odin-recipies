    <h3>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti.</li>
      <li>Oil: You'll need Â½ cup of olive oil. </li>
      <li>Garlic: Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor. </li>
      <li>Seasonings: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
      <li>Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
     
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
      <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
     
    </ol>
